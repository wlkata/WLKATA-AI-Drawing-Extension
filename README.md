## Features

### 1. Drawing Module
The Drawing Module enables users to:
- Easily convert an image into commands that a robotic arm can execute.
- Handle complex path planning for drawing with minimal setup.
- Support a wide range of robotic arms with customizable configurations.

### 2. AI Module (In future)
The AI Module includes:
- **Vision:**
  - Write digit with number it sees from camera with your own model
- **Voice:**
  - Use voice to control robotic arm 

## Usage

### Drawing Module
Hereâ€™s how you can use the Drawing Module to make your robotic arm draw an image:
```python
from drawing import Drawing

drawer = Drawing()
drawer.cali_z()
drawer.edges_from_image('sample/spiral.jpg')
drawer.extract_points_groups()
drawer.invert_point_groups()
drawer.resize_point_groups()
drawer.draw()
```
